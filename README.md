# CineSearch App

[ðŸš€Deploy](https://cinesearch-yulikk.netlify.app/)

Welcome to the CineSearch App project! This project was created as part of the RSSchool React course in 2024. The Movie Explorer website allows users to interact with a movie library, view detailed information about selected films, search the library, add movies to their favorites, and download a CSV file with the list of favorite films. The site also includes a dark/light theme toggle feature.
